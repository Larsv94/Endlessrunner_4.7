# Endlessrunner_4.7
Endlessrunner is a simple project I made for a internship interview. The idea was to create a simple endless runner game in a short period of time.
This project took me about a day and a half to make

##Gameplay
This game features the basic endless runner mechanics. The player is dropped in a endless generated parkour with pits, obstacles, coins and turns.
The player has to traverse this track as long as possible by switching lanes or jumping over obstacles. Some objects can be jumped over, others cannot. 

##Source
The C++ code can be found in the Source folder. Most base features are programmed in C++. Any gameplay related changes or additions are made in Blueprints by extending the C++ class
